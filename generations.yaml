    description: "The Mazda CX-60 marks a significant evolution in Mazda's lineup as the first model based on the company's new Large Product Group platform featuring a longitudinal engine layout and rear-wheel-drive-based architecture. Primarily designed for markets outside North America, including Europe, Japan, and Australia, it represents Mazda's upmarket strategy with premium design, materials, and powertrains. The exterior showcases an evolution of Mazda's KODO design language with elegant proportions highlighted by a long hood, cab-rearward stance, and muscular haunches reflecting its rear-drive platform. The CX-60 introduced Mazda's first plug-in hybrid powertrain, combining a 2.5L SkyActiv-G four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 323 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, enabling approximately 39 miles of electric-only range. Additional powertrain options include a 3.0L inline-six SkyActiv-X gasoline engine with mild hybrid technology and a 3.3L inline-six SkyActiv-D diesel, both featuring innovative combustion technologies. All engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard i-Activ all-wheel drive with enhanced torque distribution capabilities. The interior continues Mazda's upscale direction with higher quality materials throughout, including available Nappa leather, maple wood accents, and uniquely Japanese-inspired textiles and details. Technology features include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 12.3-inch central display controlled by a rotary commander, a drive personalization system that uses facial recognition to automatically adjust seat, steering wheel, mirrors, and driving mode settings to the driver's preferred positions, and Mi-Drive offering various driving modes including off-road settings. Advanced safety comes standard through the i-Activsense suite, with new features including intersection emergency braking and remote parking functionality. As Mazda's new flagship SUV in many markets, the CX-60 competes with premium mid-size crossovers while offering a uniquely Mazda approach to luxury focused on craftsmanship, driving dynamics, and Japanese-inspired design elements."
